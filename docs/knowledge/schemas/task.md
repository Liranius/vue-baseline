# Task

A **Task** is work-in-progress tracked as a note, so it survives context
compaction and shows up in the next session's brief. This schema is the same one
the framework-agnostic [`memory-tasks`](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/tree/main/skills/memory-tasks)
skill defines — kept identical here so the plugin and the skill agree on the
shape. For the full task workflow (creating, updating, completing), use that
skill.

Tasks are found by the SessionStart hook via structured recall:
`search_notes(metadata_filters={"type": "task", "status": "active"})`.

## Frontmatter vs observations

Put queryable fields (`status`, `priority`, `current_step`) in frontmatter so
`metadata_filters` can find them, and mirror them as `- [status] active`
observations so `schema_validate` sees them. `note_type="Task"` is stored as
lowercase `task` in frontmatter, so search with `note_types=["task"]`.
Validation is `warn` — advisory, never blocking.
