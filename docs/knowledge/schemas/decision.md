# Decision

A **DecisionNote** is a durable record of a real choice — one with alternatives
and a rationale, not a passing preference. Basic Memory host integrations
encourage agents to capture these as decisions are made or explicitly requested.

Decisions are found by structured recall:
`search_notes(metadata_filters={"type": "decision", "status": "open"})`.

## What makes a good DecisionNote

- **decision** — state the choice plainly.
- **rationale** + **alternative** — why this, and what was rejected. This is the
  part that saves a future session from relitigating the same ground.
- **consequence** — what the choice commits the work to.
- **affects** / **supersedes** — relations that wire the decision into the graph.

## Frontmatter

`type: decision` plus `status` make decisions queryable. Capture decisions
sparingly — one note per genuine decision, not per opinion. Validation is `warn`,
never blocking.
